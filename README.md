Hi! Thanks for visiting my GitHub account and for viewing my personal portfolio website.

I created my portfolio website using React.js. Also I am using GSAP for getting these cool animations and email.js which lets me get emails without having a server.
In my personal website I showcase my recent projects created with HTML, CSS and pure JavaScript that are very important components for all websites.

View the [live site](myApp) and let me know what you think.

# Install and run

This project was created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

 Install dependencies with:
  
 `npm install`

Once it's done start a local server with::

`npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
