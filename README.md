Hey there! Thanks for stopping by my GitHub and checking out my portfolio website.

I built this portfolio using React.js and added some cool animations with GSAP. For the contact form, I used email.js, which lets me receive emails without needing a server.
Here, you'll find a showcase of my projects developed with HTML, CSS, and pure JavaScript.

Feel free to view the [live site](https://anna02f.github.io/My-portfolio-website/) and let me know your thoughts.
