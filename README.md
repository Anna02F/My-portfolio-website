Hi! Thanks for visiting my account.

I have created my portfolio website using ReactJS. Also I am using GSAP for getting these cool animations and emailJS which lets me get emails without having a server.
In my personal website I showcase my recent projects created with HTML, CSS and pure JavaScript that are  essential parts for every website.

View the [live site](https://anna02f.github.io/My-portfolio-website/) and let me know what you think.

# Install and run

This project was created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

 Install dependencies with:
  
 `npm install`

Once it's done start a local server with::

`npm start`
